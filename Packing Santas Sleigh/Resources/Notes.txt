 Current Ideas
 -------------
 o Translate research paper algorithm
 o Find viable solution representation and cost function (inspiration from 2D case)
 o Reduce 3D to 2D problem
 o Represent as LP
  
 o divide into sections and apply LP on each
 o TS^2 PACK currently obtains best solution for 3D-BPP
  
 Crainic and the Extreme Points(EP's) rule (2008)
C-EPBFD composite heuristic
see "An Efficient Meta-heuristic for Mult-dimensional multi-container packing" page 3 for summary
 - this is fast
 - best constructive heuristic available
 
Paper reviews
--------------
Multiple Destination Bin Packing
 - good so far
 - too complex to implement
 - considers rotations
 - considers groups of the same box size
 - may not have good performance
 
A Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm for a 2D and 3D Bin Packing Problem
JOSÃ‰FERNANDOGONÃ‡ALVESANDMAURICIOG.C.RESENDE
 - complex to implement
 - but seems doable and can just change the fitness function
 - implement this one first
 
 An Efficient Meta-heuristic for Mult-dimensional multi-container packing
  - not detailed enough to implememnt
  - but fast and seems good
 
RectangleBinPack
 - good overview of heuristids for the 2D case
 
A Greedy Adaptive Search Procedure for Multi-Dimensional Multi-Container Packing Problems
 - seems good and fast 
 - unclear if supports rotation
 - may be difficult to implement

Packing in two and three dimensions
 - very comprehensive overview of literature
 - very complex

Three Dimensional Bin Packing Problem with Variable Bin Height
 - vague description of a simple GA
 
Recent Advances in Multi-Dimensional Packing Problems
 - excellent survey of the current state-of-the-art

- define an implicit representation of the packing by means of Interval Graphs (IG's), the Packing Class (PC) representation. The authors consider the relative position of the boxes in a feasible packing and, from
the projection of the items on each orthogonal axis, they define a graph describing the overlappings of the items in the container.
