Packing Santa's Sleigh
======================
This repository contains my horribly losing solution for the [Packing Santa's Sleigh](https://www.kaggle.com/c/packing-santas-sleigh) Kaggle contest. I partially implemented two research paper solutions and none of them will finish running in a reasonable amount of time. This code is here for my future reference.

Folder structure
================
* *Code* - contains a folder for each language {Matlab,  R, Python, Julia}
* *Resources* - contains research papers, tutorials, and other reference files

See the [contest website](https://www.kaggle.com/c/packing-santas-sleigh) for the sample submissions.
